  abstract	= {Modeling temporal sequences plays a fundamental role in
		  various modern applications and has drawn more and more
		  attentions in the machine learning community. Among those
		  efforts on improving the capability to represent temporal
		  data, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has achieved great
		  success in many areas. Although the LSTM can capture
		  long-range dependency in the time domain, it does not
		  explicitly model the pattern occurrences in the frequency
		  domain that plays an important role in tracking and
		  predicting data points over various time cycles. We propose
		  the State-Frequency Memory (SFM), a novel recurrent
		  architecture that allows to separate dynamic patterns
		  across different frequency components and their impacts on
		  modeling the temporal contexts of input sequences. By
		  jointly decomposing memorized dynamics into state-frequency
		  components, the SFM is able to offer a fine-grained
		  analysis of temporal sequences by capturing the dependency
		  of uncovered patterns in both time and frequency domains.
		  Evaluations on several temporal modeling tasks demonstrate
		  the SFM can yield competitive performances, in particular
		  as compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM models.},

		  internal dynamics can be seen as a high-dimensional,
		  nonlinear, unique transform of the input with a rich memory
		  content. This view has implications for understanding
		  neural dynamics beyond the field of reservoir computing.
		  Available definitions and theorems concerning the echo
		  state property, however, are of little practical use
		  because they do not relate the network response to temporal
		  or statistical properties of the driving input. Here we
		  present a new definition of the echo state property that
		  directly connects it to such properties. We derive a
		  fundamental 0-1 law: if the input comes from an ergodic
		  source, the network response has the echo state property
		  with probability one or zero, independent of the given
		  network. Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for
		  the echo state property that connects statistical
		  characteristics of the input to algebraic properties of the
		  network connection matrix. The mathematical methods that we
		  employ are freshly imported from the young field of
		  nonautonomous dynamical systems theory. Since these methods
		  are not yet well known in neural computation research, we
		  introduce them in some detail. As a side story, we hope to
		  demonstrate the eminent usefulness of these methods.},

  abstract	= {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most
		  challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence
		  owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of
		  evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a
		  new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks'to
		  evaluate board positions and `policy networks'to select
		  moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel
		  combination of supervised learning from human expert games,
		  and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without
		  any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the
		  level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs
		  that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We
		  also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte
		  Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this
		  search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%}
		  winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the
		  human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the
		  first time that a computer program has defeated a human
		  professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat
		  previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

		  many analysts and researchers. Popular theories suggest
		  that stock markets are essentially a random walk and it is
		  a fool&rsquo;s game to try and predict them. Predicting
		  stock prices is a challenging problem in itself because of
		  the number of variables which are involved. In the short
		  term, the market behaves like a voting machine but in the
		  longer term, it acts like a weighing machine and hence
		  there is scope for predicting the market movements for a
		  longer timeframe. Application of machine learning
		  techniques and other algorithms for stock price analysis
		  and forecasting is an area that shows great promise. In
		  this paper, we first provide a concise review of stock
		  markets and taxonomy of stock market prediction methods. We
		  then focus on some of the research achievements in stock
		  analysis and prediction. We discuss technical, fundamental,
		  short- and long-term approaches used for stock analysis.
		  Finally, we present some challenges and research
		  opportunities in this field.},
