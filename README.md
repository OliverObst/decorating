## Deep Conceptors for Temporal Data Mining

With this project, we provide the software for LRNNs (linear recurrent 
neural networks). The software has been implemented by the authors in 
Python and the scientific programming language Octave (see [octave.org](http://www.octave.org), 
version 5.2.0). It has been tested under Linux. The main routines can 
be found in "`lrnn`" implemented in Octave. For further details of LRNNs 
and their properties, the interested reader is referred to the 
following paper.
